### Project: Power consumption

**Problem**: Data for the three zone were provided, task was to find the power consumption of each zone given the power consumtion of other zones under same physical conditions like humidity, wind speed, temprature etc. 

**Purpose**: Can used to gain insights into the power consuption for newely constructed areas experiencing the same physical conditions.

**Approch**: 
- Different **machine learning** models were fitted on the dataset.
- Models were compared on the basis of **r2 score**, MSE, MASE and Time Taken to fit the models.
- 


Project Document - Jupyter Notebook 
Libraries Used - Sci-kit Learn, Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib and seaborn.
